   "instructions": "In the top left hand pane you can see the code of our `challenge.html` page. We have prepared things a bit for you. The structure is created, we have three `div`s : `#header`, `#container`and `#footer`. We have created all the necessary CSS styles, we have loaded jQuery  for you already and a script called `news.js` which gets the latest 10 news from the [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) website.\n\nBasically we will be redoing the hackernews website in a more simple way. If you look at the JS code on line 23, you will see that we already wait for the page to be loaded using `$(document).ready` from jQuery.\n\nThen we call our `getNews` function which will connect to hackernews and get us the latest 10 news items. When it's finished it will trigger our callback function with the news as a parameter called `news`. Then we have a `for` loop that goes through each of the news items and assigns them to a variable called `news_item` that you will use.\n\nWe ask you to modify `challenge.html` :\n\n1. Before the `getNews` call (line 25):\n     Set the text of `span.username` to your name using jQuery's `.text()` function.\n \n1. Before the loop (line 30):\n     Empty the `div#container` using jQuery's `.empty()` function\n\n1. Inside the loop (line 37-38):\n    1. Create `<div>` with class = `news` and id = `news_item.id`. Inside that div :\n        1. Create a `<div>` with class `author` and text `news_item.author`\n        1. Create a `<div>` with class `title` and text `news_item.text`\n        1. Create a `<a>` with href AND text `news_item.link`\n    1. Append that `div`you just created to the `#container`.\n\nHere is a full example of a news div :\n\n```\n<div class=\"news\" id=\"10219409\">\n  <div class=\"author\"> known </div>\n  <div class=\"title\"> NASA Struggles Over Deep-Space Plutonium Power </div>\n  <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/within-nasa-a-plutonium-power-struggle/\"> http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/within-nasa-a-plutonium-power-struggle/ </a>\n</div>\n```\nYou can use any method you want to create the elements for the news item.\nWhen we write `news_item.title` we want you to assign the value of the variable `news_item.title` at that place, not just the string \"news_item.title\".\n\nGood luck!",
